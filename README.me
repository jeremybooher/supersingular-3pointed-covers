# Supersingular Abelian Covers of the Projective Line Ramified over Three Points

This is code to accompany the paper "Supersingular curves via the Shimura--Taniyama method" by Jeremy Booher and Rachel Pries. It uses SageMath, and is a jupyter notebook.

The goal is to enumerate all abelian covers of the projective line ramified over three points with bounded genus which are supersingular modulo p for certain congruences class of primes. This is inspired by an old result of Ekedahl who constructed superspecial curves of genus 4 and 5 in certain characteristics using this approach. However, this approach has not been systematically explored until now. See the paper for notation and references.
